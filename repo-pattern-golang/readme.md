## Intro to Repo pattern in Golang

- The code illustrates how the Repository pattern can be implemented and used in a simple Go application. The UserRepository interface defines the contract for our repository, with the MockUserRepository providing a concrete implementation. This makes it easier to switch out the data access layer (e.g., switching from an in-memory store to a database) without affecting the rest of the application, demonstrating the pattern's strength in promoting separation of concerns and making the codebase more maintainable and testable.
